	New Features
		- Expose the external triggers functionality created in Menge 
			(see here: https://github.com/MengeCrowdSim/Menge/pull/57).
		- Add short example to exercising program to show invoking external triggers.
	Bugs
		- Corrected a build property; the debug build wouldn't run against 64-bit dlls because it
			was misconfigured to x86 instead of AnyCpu.
